			<h2>FAQ</h2>
			<hr width="25%">
			<p>Q: Why do you mod pencils?</p>
			<p>A: Why not? It's fun to do and you end up with a fun launcher that's easy for anyone to use.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: How do you set your prices?</p>
			<p>A: We set our prices fairly based on work time spent modifying and market supply and demand. Deals and specials are also included.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: How did you discover how to launch pencils?</p>
			<p>A: We were messing around and took the pencil apart. We saw that we would just have to take out one small component and the spring should be able to propel the inner pencil. We accidently broke it just right.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: What do you mean by "Professional Quality" mods?</p>
			<p>A: Our pencils are meant to last a long time. In our processs, we don't break anything that we are not supposed to and we look everything over three times before putting everything together. That's why we replace your pencil if it were to break. We make sure to test everthing multiple times to make sure nothing will come out. Our tests assure that nothing will break and the spring will NOT come out.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: How do I launch the Pencil Launcher?</p>
			<p>A: How to list:<br>
				Method #1 (best) - Launch Lead Reservoir Tube:
				<ol>
					<li>Place pad of thumb firmly on eraser.</li>
					<li>Press down as far as you want.</li>
					<li>Quickly move finger straight left or right (whichever is more comfortable) off of the eraser.</li>
				</ol>
				Method #2 (not as good but okay) - Launch Pencil Body:
				<ol>
					<li>Place pad of thumb on top of eraser with your non-dominant hand with pencil tip pointing upwards.</li>
					<li>Grab upper pencil body (near clip) with dominant hand using two fingers.</li>
					<li>Push pencil body towards eraser direction.</li>
					<li>When pencil body is as far down as possible, slide fingers down body towards eraser until the body tube releases.</li>
				</ol>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: How do I place an order?</p>
			<p>A: Find one of us and tell us what exactly you would like. You pay when you get what you want.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: Why PENCIL PWNERS?</p>
			<p>A: We were originally going for Pencil Pawn, but decided Pencil Pwn looks cooler. Pronounce it how you want to.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Q: What are the secret modifications?</p>
			<p>A: They are a secret.</p>
